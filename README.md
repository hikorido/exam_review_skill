# revision-tracker

A Claude skill that reads your actual course materials and generates a personalised, day-by-day exam revision plan — delivered as a downloadable interactive HTML checklist you can tick off as you study.

Built for students who have their lecture slides, briefings, and workbooks in a folder Claude can access via MCP.

> Originally built for a CS master's student juggling three exam courses with 25 days to go. Generalised to work for any subject, any course structure, and any deadline.

## What it does

1. **Reads your course materials** — lectures, briefings, workbook exercises, past papers — via MCP-connected folders
2. **Builds a day-by-day plan** cross-referencing the exact files you need to open each session
3. **Generates an interactive HTML tracker** you download and open in any browser — no account, no internet required after download
4. **Saves your progress** automatically using browser localStorage

Each study day gets 3 short sessions (25–35 min each), structured as:

- **READ** — the exact lecture PDF or slide segment to open
- **DO** — the specific workbook task to work through
- **RECALL** — a from-memory writing exercise to test retention

---

## Requirements

- [Claude Desktop](https://claude.ai/download) with skills support
- At least one MCP file server connected to your course materials folder

---

## Installation

1. Download [`revision-tracker.skill`](./revision-tracker.skill)
2. Open Claude Desktop
3. Go to **Settings → Skills**
4. Drag in the `.skill` file

The skill will trigger automatically whenever you mention exams and course materials.

## Usage

Just talk to Claude naturally. Some prompts that trigger it:

> *"My exams start May 15th. I have three courses — Algorithms, Systems Design, and Web Dev. Can you read my course folders and make me a revision plan?"*

> *"I need to revise for my closed-book exam in 3 weeks. Can you make me a study schedule with a checklist?"*

> *"Turn my course materials into a revision tracker I can tick off."*

Claude will ask a few questions (deadline, daily availability, any focus constraints like ADHD), explore your course folders, then generate the plan and HTML file.

## What Claude reads from your folders

| Material | Why |
|---|---|
| Lecture slide files (PDF or `.md`) | Topic list and content per week |
| Workbook `README.md` files | Exact exercises + cross-references to slides |
| Briefing PDFs | Weekly context and project briefs |
| Past exam papers | Scheduled as high-value practice sessions |

The skill cross-references all of these so each session points to the **exact file to open** — not just "read the lecture slides".

## HTML tracker features

- **Calendar grid** — one card per day, colour-coded by course
- **Clickable sessions** — tick each one off as you finish
- **Progress bar** — overall % complete across all sessions
- **Today bar** — auto-detects today's date, shows what's due and sessions done
- **Persistent state** — saves in `localStorage`, survives browser restarts
- **Offline** — works with no internet after download
- **Mobile-friendly** — calendar collapses on small screens

---

## Closed book vs open book

The skill adapts session structure based on exam format:

**Closed book** — sessions end with a paper recall exercise ("write this from memory"). Rest days and recall test days built in every ~6 days.

**Open book** — sessions focus on understanding and building a structured notes sheet to bring into the exam.

---

## Study design principles

- 3 sessions × 25–35 min per day (ADHD-friendly, no marathon study blocks)
- ~1 rest/buffer day per 6 study days
- Recall test days every week (self-testing beats rereading)
- Past paper session in the final week
- Final day is skim-only — no new material

---

## Adapting the plan

If something needs changing after the tracker is generated, just tell Claude:

> *"Actually the Web Dev exam only covers the second half of the course."*  
> *"Can you make it a dark theme?"*  
> *"I got the dates wrong — the deadline is April 28, not May 2."*

Claude will update only the affected parts rather than rebuilding from scratch.
